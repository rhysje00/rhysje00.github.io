G'day! I am a [Magma](https://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/) research fellow working in the [Comptutational algebra group](https://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/group/) at the [University of Sydney, School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/) 

My research interests include algebraic graph theory, combinatorics, finite geometry, and related computational aspects.

Previously, I was based in the [Inštitut za matematiko, fiziko in mehaniko](http://www.imfm.si/) in Ljubljana, Slovenia, where I worked on creating and curating datasets of highly symmetrical discrete objects with [Primož Potočnik](https://primoz.potocnik.xyz/). I also worked at [Sobolev Institute of Mathematics](https://math.nsc.ru/), in the Applied Abstract Algebra group led by Alexander Mednykh. I received my PhD in Mathematics at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/) in 2020, under the supervision of Professor [Leonard H. Soicher](https://webspace.maths.qmul.ac.uk/l.h.soicher/).
